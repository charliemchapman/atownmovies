Hi there. You may be finding yourself on this podcast thinking “is this some sort of questionable third rate movie podcast where two dudes sit in their mom's basements and talk about movies? What sort of insight could they possibly have on the movie Deadpool 2 that other better podcasts couldn’t have?” Let me say this: I hear you. The answer is that we’re narcissistic egomaniacs that think you should listen to this episode. But maybe that’s just enough? Probably not. But ask yourself this: if you’ve read this episode description this far haven’t you already put in enough investment to ride it out? Sure, it might not all pan out how you’ve hoped. But at this point you owe it to us and yourself to finish up here. Go ahead. Press play. Maybe you’ll like it. Probably not.
